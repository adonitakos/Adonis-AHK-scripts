# Adonis-AHK-scripts
These are my personal AutoHotkey macro scripts that I use on a daily basis to speed up my computing a bit.

A decent chunk of this were sections borrowed from the legendary of Macro King, Taran VH
Here is the exact GitHub directory where you can find those scripts: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/Almost_All_Windows_Functions.ahk.
They are essentially basic macros for Chrome and Firefox, but they should be able to work on other browsers like Edge, Opera, OperaGX, Vivaldi, etc.
I use these in conjuction with the macro keys on my Corsair K95 Platinum keyboard and the iCUE software

The rest are very basic, but very functional (in my opinion) scripts that I myself wrote.

Feel free to check them out if you want.
