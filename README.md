# Adonis-AHK-scripts
## About
These are my personal AutoHotkey macro scripts that I use on a daily basis to speed up my computing a bit. Although these are for personal use, I figured I make this repository public.

FULL DISCLOSURE: A decent chunk of these scripts were sections borrowed from Taran VH.  
Here is the exact GitHub directory where you can find those scripts: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/Almost_All_Windows_Functions.ahk. <br>
Here is a video on his YouTube channel overviewing those scripts (at least their prototypes): https://youtu.be/OqyQABySV8k <br>
They are essentially basic macros for Chrome and Firefox, but using Windows Spy, you should be able to change it to work with other browsers like Edge, Opera, OperaGX, Brave, Vivaldi, etc. I use these in conjuction with the macro keys on my Corsair K95 Platinum keyboard and the companion iCUE software.

The rest are very basic, but pretty functional (in my opinion) scripts that I wrote myself.

Feel free to check them out!

## How To Run
1. Download and install AutoHotkey --> https://www.autohotkey.com/ (I recommend *Download Current Version*)

2. Download the AHK script from this repository in one of two ways
   - Simplest way for most of you is to click the green **Code** button, and then **Download ZIP**
   - Assuming you have Git installed on your PC, open up a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and paste this command:<br/>`git clone https://github.com/adonitakos/Adonis-AHK-scripts.git`.

3. Move the AHK script (you can delete the README file and ZIP/repo folder) to a directory of your choosing. Double click it to run and you will see an **H** icon appear on the right hand side of your taskbar. 

4. Create a Shortcut of the .AHK file and place it in your Startup folder so it will run whenever you boot your system. Just press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, then type `shell:startup` and it will bring you to that directory.

5. Open up a text editor of your choosing (Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.) to view the scripts and make any desired modifications.
