# Adonis-AHK-scripts
## About
These are my personal AutoHotkey macro scripts that I use on a daily basis to speed up my computing a bit.

FULL DISCLOSURE: A decent chunk of this were sections borrowed from the legendary Macro King, Taran VH.  
Here is the exact GitHub directory where you can find those scripts: https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/Almost_All_Windows_Functions.ahk.

They are essentially basic macros for Chrome and Firefox, but using Windows Spy, you should be able to change it to work with other browsers like Edge, Opera, OperaGX, Vivaldi, etc. I use these in conjuction with the macro keys on my Corsair K95 Platinum keyboard and the companion iCUE software.

The rest are very basic, but pretty functional (in my opinion) scripts that I myself wrote.

Feel free to check them out if you want.

## How To Run
1. Download and install AutoHotkey --> https://www.autohotkey.com/ (I recommend *Downlaod Current Version*)
    - You can also install it via the Windows Package Manager, ***winget***; it's present in Windows 11 and for Windows 10 you might have it with the most up to date version or       might have refer to this https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli). However, winget isn't perfect right now, so the official website might be a better option.

2. Download the AHK script from this repository in one of two ways
   - Simplest way for most of you is to click the green **Code** button, and then **Download ZIP**
   - Assuming you have Git installed on your PC, open up a terminal (Command Prompt or Powershell) and `git clone https://github.com/adonitakos/Adonis-AHK-scripts.git`.

3. Move the AHK script (you can delete the README file and ZIP/repo folder) to a directory of your choosing. Double click it to run and you will see an **H** icon appear on the      left in your taskbar. 

4. Create a Shortcut of the .AHK file and place it in your Startup folder so it will run whenever you reboot your PC. This is the directory to look for: C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

5. Open up a text editor of your choosing (Notepad, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime, etc.) to make any modifications.
